Maritime Logistics Optimization (Berth Scheduling)

This project formulates and solves the berth scheduling problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model.
It was developed as a course project for Operations Research II, focusing on shipâ€“berth assignment, sequencing, and service-level optimization using Pyomo and Gurobi.
